## Server Calls vs API Routes
We are using latest nextjs server side logic and should never use API routes for accessing data when we can use server side functions instead

## Data Access
reference [data-access-layer.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/data-access-layer.mdc) for guidelines anytime you are trying to manipulate data

## Drizzle Commands
- `npx drizzle-kit generate --name <migration-name>` to generate a new migration
- `npx drizzle-kit migrate` to migrate the database
- Do not inclue :pg on any of the commands
